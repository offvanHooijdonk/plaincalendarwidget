# plain calendar widget

Open-source widget for Google Calendar.

My principles in building and designing it were:
* Minimalistic design, occupy less space while provided sufficient data
* Easy to configure, live preview, a number of plain layouts, date/time presentation can vary
* Setup color and background is pretty enough for personalization

* propose fixes and code enhancemets 🚀
* bug report 🪲
* request features 🌟
* fork and develop as long as you **keep it non-commercial** ✌️.
